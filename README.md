# Windows Screen Time App
This repository contains a simple time limit application developed using Visual C#. The app allows users to set a time limit and receive notifications when the specified time is reached. It's a helpful tool for managing time-sensitive tasks or activities.

# How to Open the App:
To open the Time Limit App in Visual Studio:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine. Open Visual Studio. In Visual Studio, navigate to File > Open > Project/Solution. Browse to the location where you cloned or downloaded the repository and select the solution file. Click Open to open the solution in Visual Studio. Once the solution is opened, you can build and run the project to launch the Time Limit App. Feel free to explore the code, clone, and customize the app to suit your needs. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.

# How to Download the App:
To download the app, simply go to the release page and click on screen-time.exe; the file will automatically download. Then, all you have to do is run the setup. After the app setup is complete, create a shortcut on your desktop or in a location of your choice. Then press Win + R, which will open a popup window at the bottom that says "Run." After that, type 'shell:startup', and add the app's main shortcut to the folder. This step will allow the app to start when the computer starts. Once you've completed all the steps above, you're good to go!

# Warning:
If you open this app, it cannot be closed easily, which is intentional because it is a screen time management tool. If you want to change the screen time limit, go to the settings tab and paste the password, which is stored in the source code file Form1.cs on line 275. If you really want to close this app, you can't, but there is one way: go to the task manager and find the app named "browser 32 bit," which is a disguise. Then, end the task. If you are using this for parental control, it is recommended to end it from the task manager if it is not an emergency.
